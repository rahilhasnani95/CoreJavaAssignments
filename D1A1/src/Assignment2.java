	/*
	 * ANSWER A: Student class attributes: private static int studentId; private
	 * String studentName; private Marks marks; (marks will be a different class)
	 * 
	 * public int viewMarks() {
	 * 
	 * } public int viewAttendance() {
	 * 
	 * } all attributes will be private and all their getters and setters will be
	 * public and other emethods will also be public
	 * 
	 * ANSWER B : calculate grade should be overridden in all the other classes of
	 * students which extends student class The signature of the methods will be
	 * same and the implementation will be different like for grad student it will
	 * be different coz it has project marks and for post grad student it will be
	 * different because it has thesis marks
	 * 
	 * ANSWER C: We need to just create 1 function in the Student class and we can
	 * override that function in both Hostelite and Dayscholar class and provide
	 * different implementation in both classes.
	 * 
	 * ANSWER D: For answer a, Encapsulation is acheived by using private attributes
	 * and public getters and setter and other methods For answer b, Polymorphism is
	 * achieved because Method overriding is done. For answer c, Polymorphism and
	 * Inheritance is achieved coz we are extending both Hostelite and Dayscholar
	 * classes from Student class
